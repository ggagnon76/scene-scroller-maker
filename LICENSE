function properly, this module can be considered 'abandoned' by "League of 
Extraordinary Foundry VTT Developers" admins or (an) interested developer(s)

Once determined to be abandoned, "League of Extraordinary Foundry VTT
Developers" admins or (an) interested developer(s) may request the Foundry VTT
